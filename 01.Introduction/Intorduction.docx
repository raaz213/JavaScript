Introduction to JavaScript
🔹 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a client-side scripting language mainly used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.

It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape.

Runs directly in the browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

It is one of the core technologies of the web along with HTML and CSS.

🔹 Why JavaScript?

HTML → Provides structure of a web page.

CSS → Provides style and design.

JavaScript → Provides interactivity and behavior.

🔹 Features of JavaScript

Lightweight & simple – Easy to learn and use.

Interpreted – Runs directly in the browser without compilation.

Event-driven – Can respond to user actions (clicks, inputs, etc.).

Cross-platform – Runs on any browser and device.

Versatile – Can be used for:

Frontend (Browser scripting – e.g., form validation, animations).

Backend (via Node.js – server-side apps, APIs).

Mobile & Desktop apps (with frameworks like React Native, Electron).

🔹 Example: First JavaScript Program
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello JavaScript</h1>

  <script>
    // This will show a popup message
    alert("Welcome to JavaScript!");
  </script>
</body>
</html>


✅ When you open this in a browser, it will display a popup box saying “Welcome to JavaScript!”

🔹 What JavaScript Can Do?

Validate form input (e.g., check if email is entered).

Create interactive UI (sliders, dropdowns, popups).

Manipulate HTML & CSS dynamically (DOM manipulation).

Fetch data from servers (AJAX / Fetch API).

Create web apps, games, mobile apps, and even server-side apps.
